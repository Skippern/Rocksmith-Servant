This project was made to help you to use Rocksmith and make a connection between
Rocksmith (RS), Rock Sniffer, RS Playlist, Custom Forge Song Manager (CFSM) and so on during streaming.

A complete documentation will be provided later.

Main functions (this is just a raw list now):

- Loads a song from the archive of the user according to the playlist request to the Rocksmith (or with the CFSM
  monitored directory)
- Creates a setlist what is contains the played songs
- Moves a downloaded file (even over LAN) to the CFSM monitored directory and retry it if CFSM does not loaded properly.
